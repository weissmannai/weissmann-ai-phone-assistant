## Use Case 1: Missed Calls During Peak Hours

**Problem**  
Restaurants in Switzerland receive most calls during lunch and dinner service.

**Result**  
- Better guest experience  
- More bookings from tourists  
- No language barriers

## Use Case 3: Small Teams & High Labor Costs

## Use Case 4: Sales-Oriented Call Handling

**Problem**  
Many phone systems only take messages and do not convert calls into revenue.

**Solution**  
Weissmann uses active sales logic:
- Suggests available time slots
- Promotes events or specials
- Secures bookings during the call

**Result**  
- Higher conversion rate per call  
- Increased daily revenue

## Use Case 5: Non-SaaS, On-Site Configuration

**Problem**  
Generic SaaS tools fail because they are not adapted to real restaurant workflows.

**Solution**  
Weissmann is not a self-serve SaaS.
A dedicated expert team configures the assistant directly with each restaurant:
- Menu logic
- Table rules
- Peak times
- Guest flow

**Result**

- Real-world reliability
