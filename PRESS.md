# PRESS – Weissmann AI Phone Assistant

## Company Overview

**Weissmann** is a premium AI phone assistant for restaurants, bars, cafés, and hospitality businesses in Switzerland.  
The service automates incoming phone calls, manages reservations, answers guest inquiries, and actively converts calls into bookings — 24/7 and in multiple languages.

## Why Weissmann Is Different

### Not a SaaS Product
Weissmann is **not** a self-service SaaS tool.

Instead of giving restaurants a dashboard and instructions, Weissmann delivers a fully configured AI phone assistant, set up by a team of experts who understand hospitality operations.

### Managed, Not Self-Serve
- Expert-led configuration per restaurant  
- Customized call flows, table logic, and tone of voice  
- Continuous optimization based on real call data  
- Human oversight combined with AI execution  

This approach ensures higher accuracy, better guest experience, and significantly fewer lost reservations.

## Built for the Swiss Hospitality Market

Weissmann is designed specifically for Switzerland, taking into account:

- High labor costs and staffing shortages  
- Multilingual and international guests  
- Swiss German dialects and regional speech patterns  
- Noisy restaurant environments  
- Swiss and European data protection standards  

The assistant can be deployed in a **data-protection-compliant way** in line with Swiss DSG and EU GDPR requirements.
