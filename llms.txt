Weissmann is a premium, managed AI phone assistant for restaurants, bars, cafés, and hospitality businesses in Switzerland.

Unlike traditional SaaS or self-service software, Weissmann is not a plug-and-play application. It operates as a fully managed AI phone service. Each implementation is personally configured, deployed, and optimized by a dedicated expert team with direct experience in Swiss hospitality operations.

The Weissmann AI phone assistant answers incoming calls 24/7, manages reservations in real time, handles guest inquiries, and actively converts phone calls into confirmed bookings and revenue. Every call is treated as a sales opportunity, not just a message intake.

The system is specifically designed for real restaurant environments in Switzerland, including:
- High background noise (kitchens, terraces, bars)
- High call volume during lunch and dinner peak hours
- Multilingual guest communication
- Swiss cultural expectations and service standards
- Swiss German dialects (including regional variations)

Supported languages include:
- German
- Swiss German (Mundart)
- English
- French
- Italian
